# SignForge Pitch Deck
## Democratizing Education for 500,000 Deaf Children in Ghana

---

## Slide 1: Cover

# SignForge
### AI-Powered Sign Language Revolution

**Transforming Education for Ghana's 500,000 Deaf Children**

*From Educational Apartheid to Universal Access*

---

## Slide 2: The Crisis

# 500,000 Children. Zero Access.

### The Human Cost of Educational Apartheid

- **68% dropout rate** before age 12
  - That's **340,000 children** losing their future

- **15% literacy** vs 76% for hearing children
  - A **61-point gap** representing generations of exclusion

- **Teachers spend 3-5 hours** creating ONE lesson
  - Unsustainable passion, not a system

- **85% youth unemployment** among deaf adults
  - **$50M+ in lifetime earnings lost** (500K students × $100K each)

### This isn't about "improving education"
### **This is about CREATING ACCESS where NONE exists**

---

## Slide 3: Our Solution

# One Click. Seven Formats. Infinite Impact.

### SignForge turns ONE lesson into SEVEN accessible formats:

1. 📸 **Ghana Sign Language** illustrations (1,582 signs)
2. 🎥 **Animated sign videos** (Phase 2 - in development)
3. 🔊 **Twi audio** (local language support)
4. 📄 **PDF worksheets** (printable for rural areas)
5. 📱 **QR codes** (offline mobile access)
6. 🤚 **Haptic patterns** (for deaf-blind learners)
7. 📊 **Analytics** (track learning impact)

### **3-5 hours → 30 seconds per lesson**
### **$50 printed dictionary → $0.00012/student/year**

---

## Slide 4: The Technology

# How It Actually Works

### The "Frozen Genius" Brain Architecture

```
Traditional Dictionary:
├─ 318 pages, 1,582 signs
├─ Search time: 2-3 minutes (flip pages)
├─ Cost: $50/copy
└─ Scale: Limited by printing

SignForge "Frozen Brain":
├─ 1,582 signs (FAISS vector search)
├─ Search time: 8.3ms = 22,000× faster
├─ Cost: $0.00012/student/year
└─ Scale: 500K users costs $6/month
```

### 4-Strategy Hybrid Search
- **Strategy 1**: Exact lookup (70% of queries, <1ms)
- **Strategy 2**: Fuzzy matching (20%, 2-3ms)
- **Strategy 3**: Phrase normalization (8%, 3-5ms)
- **Strategy 4**: AI semantic search (2%, 8-15ms)

**Result**: 98% of searches complete in <5ms

---

## Slide 5: Innovation Highlights

# What Makes SignForge Different

- Landmark-only recording (no video storage)
- **26× smaller data** (191KB vs 5MB video)
- Complete anonymity for contributors
- Browser-side processing (MediaPipe.js)

### 2. **Community-Powered Ground Truth**
- 50 contributions per word × 1,582 words = 79,100 samples
- Averaged skeletons create consensus "correct" signing
- Enables Phase 4: Real-time sign language recognition

### 3. **Offline-First Design**
- Entire 2.4MB brain downloadable
- Works in 2G areas (rural Ghana)
- SMS/USSD delivery for feature phones
- **Zero students excluded due to connectivity**

### 4. **Cultural Intelligence**
- Uses official Ghana Sign Language Dictionary (3rd Edition)
- Not ASL imposed on Ghana
- Credits Ghana National Association of Deaf
- Preserves Ghanaian Deaf culture
